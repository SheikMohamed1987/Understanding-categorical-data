Feature engineering is a crucial step in building a performant machine learning model. Understanding categorical variables and encoding those variables with right encoding techniques is of paramount importance during data cleaning and preparation stage. A survey published on Forbes says that Data preparation accounts for about 80% of the work of data scientists. Data scientists spend 60% of their time on cleaning and organizing data. 
In this article, we will look at various encoding techniques in Python with examples to better understand how to transform categorical data to make it model ready.
